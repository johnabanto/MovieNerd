This project was a really fun project to work on and I was really excited to do it. We were introduced into using AngularJS and routes to set this project up as well as using the IMDB open API. The concept of routes was pretty simple but challenging when trying to write the code. Utilizing previous techniques to bind data from the API was good excercise and when I was able to set the routes correctly it was rewarding. Overall my favorite project I have done so far in this cohort.
